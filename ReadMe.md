## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

Instructions:
You can run this assignment by running the python program matrixmultiplyp1.py

Issues encountered:
None. However most of my python implementations were based on java programming 
instead of python programming. As this class progresses, I expect to sharpen my 
python programmng skill.

Also,
I'm not sure if I was supposed to add my code into the matrixUtils.py file.

How I overcame some problems:
I was looking into lists and how they work from online sources.

Bugs in program:
None that I could find

How long it took me to complete this assignment:
About 1 hour, as I was looking for instructions on the assignment syllabus and
the assignmnt itself.

Performance Measurements:
My computer only has 2 cores with 4 threads each.
To multiply a square matrix of 256x256 it took ~13.5 seconds.
Increasing that by 1 bit to 512x512, it took ~ 105 seconds (~2 minutes).

Increasing # of Threads:
